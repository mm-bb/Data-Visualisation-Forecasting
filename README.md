                          Data Visualisation and Forecasting (MIR)
Adventure Hardware Group (AHG) is a global manufacturing organisation with operations in
America, Europe and Asia. AHG has been experiencing a shift in the market place towards digital
as well as change in customer demographic, possibly leading to decline in its store sales. To make
the strategic shift toward a greater digital share of wallet and overall growth, AHG has engaged
Kernel Decision Science Limited to help it find a solution to this problem. Among its requirements,
AHG need Kernel to develop a Business Intelligence and Insight Visualisation capability to better
understand and monitor key trends over time. The goal is to create commercial action plan as well
as an integrated data visualisation and a dynamic analytics system using traditional software tools.
The system must auto-fresh whenever new data sources are ingested into the system; use Excel,
Tableau, QlikView, Business Objects or similar as your data visualisation software.

1. Identify areas where AHG could improve existing processes (i.e., where costs are too high,
pricing is inadequate, inefficient supply chain processes, inadequate discounting policy,
inefficient supplier management, poor quality operations) and reduce cost and must track
change over time across regions.
2. Create a 5 year forecast of quarterly sales for each region. Are sales growing as fast as the 
market or not? Either way, using evidence from the data only, what can AHG do to continue to 
improve its position in the market?
3. Identify which products and regions are doing better or worse against the market,
benchmarked against manufacturers of similar products, e.g. Halfords and similar, as well as
online hardware retailers in similar space as AHG. (Present this part in 15-20 page deck)
4. If products where to be shelved in the stores, or advertised online, what products may be
shelved together given that these products are historically purchased together?
5. What should AHG Digital strategy be? Should it close its stores and migrate fully online across
all regions or some regions? If some, which regions should be migrated fully online, and what
is the likely impact of this aggressive strategy?
